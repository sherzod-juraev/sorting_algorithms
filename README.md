# Sorting Algorithms in Python

This project contains various **sorting algorithms** implemented in Python.  
Some algorithms are intentionally written in a slightly different way than the classical approach to make the logic easier to understand.

## ðŸ“š List of Algorithms

- **Bubble Sort** â€“ Adaptive bubble sort implementation
- **Selection Sort** â€“ Selection sort (implemented in reverse order for better understanding)
- **Insertion Sort** â€“ Standard insertion sort
- **Shell Sort** â€“ Shell sort algorithm
- **Merge Sort** â€“ Merge sort (Divide and Conquer approach)
- **Quick Sort** â€“ Quick sort with a basic median-of-three idea

Features
Each algorithm is implemented as a separate function.

Type checking included (isinstance(array, list)).

Slight deviations from the classical method are used for educational clarity.

Compatible with Python 3.x.
